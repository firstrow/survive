# My 2.5D simple game engine.

I've always liked how Age Of Empire game looked. Pre-rendered games always had some charm in it.
So, I've decided to improve my C skills by building "simple" survival game in isometric game style.
As usual, the task was too big and I decied to stop working on it.

(mix textures).
